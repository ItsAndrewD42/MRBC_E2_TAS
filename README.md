Resources created for the Monster Rancher Battle Card - Episode II TAS

All Lua scripts assume the save slot is placed on the frame before the "event" happens (whether that's the deck generation or reward generation). You can find these using the provided .wch files in the RAM Watch tool. I then used the "frame counter" to offset the last button press before the "event" in order to manipulate the RNG accordingly.

Skill card IDs and rarities are in the SkillCards.csv file

I haven't exported the full "Battle Rewards" info from the game code yet but I will at some point.
